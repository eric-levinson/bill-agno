## Task receipt & plan

I'll document the prioritized recommendations I gave earlier (no code changes), map them to the repository hotspots, and add a short research summary from Agno docs about orchestration, parallel steps, and caching patterns. This file is a concise reference you can use when implementing the changes.

### Checklist (requirements)
- [x] Document prioritized, code-mapped recommendations (from previous review of `team_playground.py` and related files).
- [x] Add an actionable rollout plan and quick wins.
- [x] Summarize Agno best-practices relevant to batching, parallel execution, workflows, and caching.

## Prioritized recommendations (highest bang-for-buck first)

1) Shared caching layer for metadata & lookups (Very High impact)
- What to cache: `get_metrics_metadata`, player lookups (`get_player_info_tool`, `get_players_by_sleeper_id_tool`), frequently-requested league metadata (rosters/users), and hot query results.
- Where to add: in `GridironTools._call_remote` (short-circuit for known tool names) or as a separate `CacheToolkit` that agents consult before calling GridironTools.
- Effort: prototype 1–2 days; production (Redis + invalidation) + tests: +2 days.
- Risk: staleness — mitigate with short TTLs and event-driven/manual invalidation.

2) Enforce/automate batching of analytics calls (High impact, Low effort)
- What: Always pass arrays for `player_names`, `metrics`, `season_list` in a single analytics call rather than multiple per-player calls.
- Where to add: Supervisor/Team orchestration (in `team_playground.py`) and a small normalizer helper in `gridiron_toolkit/info.py`.
- Effort: ~0.5–1 day.

3) Parallelize independent tool calls (High impact, Medium effort)
- What: Use `asyncio.gather` with a bounded semaphore to run independent calls concurrently (e.g., metadata + player resolution + roster fetch).
- Where to add: Supervisor orchestration and agent flows that call multiple tools sequentially.
- Effort: 1–3 days.

4) Add a simple Query Planner / Aggregator (High impact, Medium effort)
- What: Rule-based planner that inspects user intent and outputs an execution plan (which tool calls, which to batch, which to run in parallel).
- Where to add: new Planner class invoked early in the Supervisor flow (before calling team members).
- Effort: 2–4 days for initial version.

5) Instrumentation & tracing (Low effort, foundational)
- What: Add spans/metrics for each `_call_remote`, number of remote calls per user request, cache hit/miss, and per-tool latency (p50/p95/p99).
- Benefit: data-driven prioritization and validation of improvements.

6) Prefetch / warm caches (Medium-high impact)
- What: scheduled jobs to prefetch popular players/metadata (e.g., gameday prefetch). Use cache after instrumentation shows hot keys.

7) Async HTTP clients / connection pooling (Medium effort)
- What: ensure MCP client and any HTTP calls use an async client (httpx/aiohttp) with connection pools and keep-alive.

8) Rate-limiting, backoff, circuit-breakers (Medium effort)
- Add resilience wrappers around slow external endpoints to avoid blocking user-facing flows.

## Concrete code hotspots (where to change)
- `gridiron_toolkit/info.py` — `GridironTools._call_remote`: ideal place for caching, adding OTEL spans, and consistent parameter normalization.
- `team_playground.py` — Supervisor / `Team(...)` orchestration: add Planner invocation and parallel execution logic.
- Agent helpers (the Agent definitions in `team_playground.py`) — minimal changes to call the Planner or use cache helpers.
- MCP client (if present elsewhere) — switch to pooled async HTTP client, add retry/backoff.

## Minimal, safe first steps (recommended rollout)
1. Add OTEL spans + counters around `_call_remote` and Supervisor entrypoints (1 day).
2. Add in-process LRU cache for `get_metrics_metadata` and player lookups (1 day). Measure hit/miss.
3. Normalize parameters for analytics tools and update Supervisor to batch player/metric arrays (0.5–1 day).
4. Parallelize independent calls with `asyncio.gather` + bounded concurrency (1–3 days).
5. Add Query Planner (2–5 days). Promote cache to Redis and add invalidation/prefetch jobs (3–5 days).

## Quick experiment plan (to measure wins)
- Baseline: record p50/p95/p99 and number of remote calls per request for a set of 10 representative queries.
- Iteration 1: enable cache for metadata + player lookups, re-run queries and compare.
- Iteration 2: batch analytics calls for multi-player queries, re-run queries.
- Iteration 3: enable parallel execution for independent calls.
- Track: latency (p50/p95/p99), number of external calls, cache hit rate, and error rates.

## Agno research summary (relevant findings)
- Agno provides explicit constructs for workflows and parallel execution (Steps, Parallel, Condition). Example: `Parallel(research_hn_step, research_web_step, ...)` for concurrent research tasks; this pattern is a direct match for running independent tool calls concurrently.
- Agno workflow examples show caching integration in higher-level workflows (check cache first, scrape/search with cache flags, then persist results). These examples match the recommendation to add a cache layer to avoid repeated searches/metadata calls.
- Agno docs include async tool examples and agent methods that support concurrent tool calls (agents can register async tools and run them in parallel). This confirms the code-level feasibility of `asyncio.gather` and bounded concurrency wrappers.
- Practical patterns from Agno docs to reuse:
	- Rule-based workflows: small, deterministic planners (Steps + Condition) are first-class and simple to implement.
	- Use of caching gates in workflows (check cache -> fetch -> store) to short-circuit expensive steps.
	- Parallel step primitives to run independent research/IO-bound tasks concurrently and then aggregate results.

## Notes / risks
- Primary risk is data staleness from caching; mitigate with TTLs, invalidation hooks, and manual refresh options.
- Concurrency risks: start with conservative concurrency limits and monitor rate-limit errors.

## Next steps I can take (pick one)
- Add OTEL spans + metrics in `GridironTools._call_remote` and a simple cache prototype (in-process LRU) and run a small benchmark (I will implement and run tests).  [recommended first step]
- Implement the parameter-normalizer + enforce batching in Supervisor.
- Design the rule-based Planner and a small exec harness to run planned calls concurrently.
